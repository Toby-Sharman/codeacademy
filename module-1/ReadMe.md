# Module 1
Module 1 is the introduction module.

## Exercise 1
In exercise 1 you create a simple "Hello World" piece of code.

```

print "Hello World"

```

## Exercise 2
In exercise 2 you use python version 3's syntax.

```

# Version 2
print "Hello World"

# Version 3
print ("Hello World")

```

## Exercise 3
In exercise 3 you combine two strings.

```

print "Hello " + "World"

```

## Exercise 4
In exercise 4 you repair two print statements, you would change the apostrophes so they are correctly positioned or add them in.

## Exercise 5
In exercise 5 you create a variable.

```

Hello World = 22

```

## Exercise 6
In exercise 6 you use arithmetic (they follow the usual order of operations BIDMAS).
<br>
If you use % in accompany with division it will give you the remainder, the division with remainder would equal 1 as 7 divided by 2 equals 3 remainder 1.

```

addition = 12381 + 91817
subtraction = 981 - 312
multiplication = 38 * 902
division = 540 / 45
combinations = 129 * 1345 + 120 / 6 - 12
division_with_remainder = 7 % 2

```

## Exercise 7
In exercise 6 you update variables the code bellow will make the sandwich_price equal to the total of the original sandwich_price value (7.50) + the value of sales_tax (sandwich_price * 0.08) and also changes the value of the money_in_wallet equal to the original money_in_wallet value (40) - the new value of the sandwich_price (8.10).

```

money_in_wallet = 40
sandwich_price = 7.50
sales_tax = .08 * sandwich_price

sandwich_price += sales_tax
money_in_wallet -= sandwich_price

```

## Exercise 8
In exercise 6 you describe the code using the hashtag symbol, meaning it does nothing to the output and is only visual on the code.

```

#Hello World

```

## Exercise 9
In exercise 9 you give variables numerical values, an integer is a whole number; whilst a decimal is described as a float (they are defined by using a decimal point whether within the number, 2.6, or at the end, 4., ). You can also define a float using scientific notation, with e indicating the power of 10.

```

int1 = 1
int2 = 10
int3 = -5

float1 = 1.0
float2 = 10.
float3 = -5.5

float4 = 1.5e2 = 1.5 * 10 ** 2

```

## Exercise 10
In exercise 10 you get a whole number out of a sum, that would usually leave you with a decimal, it will round the number down; integer_remaining_after_division would therefore equal 16.

```

integer_remaining_after_division = 50 % 3

```

## Exercise 11
In exercise 11 you create multi line strings; by putting """ at the start and end of a section it will act as if there is a hashtag on each line.

```

"""
Hello
Hello
Hello
"""

```

## Exercise 12
In exercise 12 you assign variables a Boolean, True or False.

```

a = True
b = False

```

## Exercise 13
In exercise 13 you learn that python automatically assigns a variable the appropriate datatype based on the value it is given. A variable with the value 7 is an integer, 7. is a float, "7" is a string. Sometimes we will want to convert variables to different datatypes. For example, if we wanted to print out an integer as part of a string, we would want to convert that integer to a string first. We can do that using str(). The first example will print I am 13 years old! Similarly, if we have a string like "7" and we want to perform arithmetic operations on it, we must convert it to a numeric datatype. We can do this using int(). In the second example string_addition equals 10010 and int_addition equals 110.If you use int() on a floating point number, it will round the number down. To preserve the decimal, you can use float(). On the third example print int(string_num) equals 7 and print float(string_num) equals 7.5.
string_num = "7.5"

```

age = 13
print "I am " + str(age) + " years old!"

number1 = "100"
number2 = "10"
string_addition = number1 + number2
int_addition = int(number1) + int(number2)

print int(string_num)
print float(string_num)

```

## Exercise 14
Is Just a summary
