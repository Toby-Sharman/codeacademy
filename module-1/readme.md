# Module 1
Module 1 is the introduction module

## Exercise 1
In exercise 1 you create a simple "Hello World" piece of code

```

print "Hello World"

```

## Exercise 2
In exercise 2 you use python version 3's syntax

```

# Version 2
print "Hello World"

# Version 3
print ("Hello World")

```

## Exercise 3
In exercise 3 you combine two strings

```

print "Hello " + "World"

```

## Exercise 4
In exercise 4 you repair two print statements

## Exercise 5
In exercise 5 you create a variable

```

Hello World = 22

```

## Exercise 6
In exercise 6 you use arithmetic (They follow the usual order of operations BIDMAS)
<br>
If you use % in accompany with division it will give you the remainder, the division with remainder would equal 1 as 7 divided by 2 equals 3 remainder 1

```

addition = 12381 + 91817
subtraction = 981 - 312
multiplication = 38 * 902
division = 540 / 45
combinations = 129 * 1345 + 120 / 6 - 12
division_with_remainder = 7 % 2

```

## Exercise 7
In exercise 6 you update variables the code bellow will make the sandwich_price equal to the total of the original sandwich_price value (7.50) + the value of sales_tax (sandwich_price * 0.08) and also changes the value of the money_in_wallet equal to the original money_in_wallet value (40) - the new value of the sandwich_price (8.10)

```

money_in_wallet = 40
sandwich_price = 7.50
sales_tax = .08 * sandwich_price

sandwich_price += sales_tax
money_in_wallet -= sandwich_price

```

## Exercise 8
In exercise 6 you describe the code using the hashtag symbol

```
